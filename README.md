# SmoothPHP
PHP Framework made in my spare time that focuses on removing many of the trivial responsibilities from the developer, but still guarantees fast and secure operation of the tasks it takes away from the developer.

# Installation instructions
Instructions on how to use this framework can be found [here](https://github.com/Ikkerens/SmoothPHP/wiki/Installation-(Unix-Linux)).
